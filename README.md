```js
import { CFToolsClient } from '@md-oss/cftools.js'; // ESM
const { CFToolsClient } = require('@md-oss/cftools.js'); // CommonJS

// Instantiate our client, the `serverApiId` can be
// omitted and overwritten in individual requests
const client = new CFToolsClient({
  applicationId: process.env.CFTOOLS_APPLICATION_ID,
  applicationSecret: process.env.CFTOOLS_APPLICATION_SECRET,
  serverApiId: process.env.CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID,
});

// Do something with the client
```
